## Why

I wanted the ability to spin up a blog and fetch content from my website with ease. The same way you get a fully functional Postgres database with Supabase and connect to it in a few minutes, I wanted the same for my blog or content needs.

Headless CMS solutions are great, but they are often too complex and pricey for simple use cases. I wanted something that was simple to use, but still powerful enough to handle my needs.

In my opinion, headless CMS solutions are too pricey when you just want to fetch some text and images and render it in your website.

## Tech Stack

`Zenblog` is built with the following epic technologies & tools:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) Database, Auth, Storage, Functions
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) Vue based FrontEnd & Backend + modules
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS Engine
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Needs no introduction

_p.s. Things will change over time!_
